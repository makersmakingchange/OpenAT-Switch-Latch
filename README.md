# OpenAT Switch Latch 
The OpenAT Switch Latch is a switch adapter that enables a standard momentary assistive switch to be used as a toggle switch or latch. Activating and releasing the input switch will turn on and hold on the output. Activating and releasing the input switch again will turn the connected output device off. The device requires one CR2032 coin cell battery for operation. 

This device was developed as several assistive switch users requested the ability to control lights and other devices in a semi-permanent manner utilizing their preferred momentary assistive switches.

## Usage
To setup the OpenAT Switch Latch, a momentary switch is plugged into the 3.5 mm jack marked 'Input' and the device to be controlled is plugged into the 3.5 mm jack marked 'Output'.

To use the device it must be powered on by sliding the Power Switch towards the left to the On position. When the assistive switch is activated, the LED indicator light will turn on and remain on, and the output device will be activated. When the assistive switch is activated again, the LED indicitor light will turn off and remain off, and the output device will be deactivated.

## How to Obtain a OpenAT-Switch-Latch
### 1. Do it Yourself (DIY) or Do it Together (DIT)

This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build the OpenAT-Switch-Latch are contained within this repository. Refer to the Maker Checklist below.

### 2. Request a build of this device

If you would like to obtain a OpenAT Switch Latch, you may submit a build request through the [MMC Library Page](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/product/switch-latch/01tJR00000095zlYAA). The requestor is responsible for the cost of materials and any shipping.

### 3. How to build this device for someone else

If you have the skills and equipment to build this device, and would like to donate your time to create the switch for someone who needs it, visit the [MMC Maker Wanted](https://makersmakingchange.com/maker-wanted/) section.


## Getting Started

### 1. Read the Makers Checklist

The [Makers Checklist](/Documentation/OpenAT_Switch_Latch_Maker_Checklist.pdf) provides an overview of the steps required to build this device.

### 2. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/OpenAT_Switch_Latch_BOM.csv) lists all of the parts and components required to build the OpenAT-Switch-Latch. The main switch component needs to be ordered online. The rest of the off-the-shelf components are also online or may be available in smaller quantities at your local hardware store or dollar store.

### 3. Order the PCBs

The [Gerber_Files](/Build_Files/PCB_Build_Files/Gerber_Files) includes the PCB build information which can be submitted to PCB fabrication service to create the custom PCB. Please refer to MMC-PCB for more information on custom PCB fabrication.

### 4. Print the 3D Printable components

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 5. Assemble the OpenAT-Switch-Latch

Reference the [Assembly Guide](/Documentation/OpenAT_Switch_Latch_Assembly_Guide.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
